\section{Aims \& Scope} 

These are my personal notes on linear algebraic groups. These notes are based on the book~\cite{Malle_Testerman_2011}. 

\subsection{History}

\section{Basic Concepts}

\begin{Definition}
    A \textbf{linear algebraic group} is an affine algebraic variety equipped with a group structure such that the group operations (multiplication and inversion) are morphisms of varieties. Let $\mu : G \times G \to G$ denote multiplication and $i : G \to G$ denote inversion. The space $G \times G$ is an affine algebraic variety equipped with the Zariski topology. 
\end{Definition}


\begin{Example}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The additive group $G = (k, +)$ corresponds to the zero ideal in $k[x]$. Addition and inversion are given by polynomials. Hence $G$ is an algebraic group with coordinate ring $k[G] = k[x]$. This group is called the \textbf{additive group}, denoted $\mathbf{G}_a$. 

        \item The multiplicative group $G = (k^\times, \cdot)$ can be identified with the pairs $V(xy-1) = \{(x, y) \in k^2 : xy = 1\}$. The multiplication operation on $V(xy-1)$ is given by the polynomials $(x_1, y_1) \cdot (x_2, y_2) = (x_1x_2, y_1y_2)$ and the inverse is given by the polynomial map $(x, y) \mapsto (y, x)$. In this case, $k[G] \simeq k[x,y]/(xy-1) \simeq k[x^\pm]$. This group is called the \textbf{multiplicative group}, denoted $\mathbf{G}_m$. 

        \item The \textbf{general linear group} $\GL_n \eqdef \{ A \in k^{n \times n} : \det (A) \neq 0 \}$ is an algebraic group. Indeed, $\GL_n$ can be identified with the algebraic set 
        \[
            \{ (A, t) \in k^{n \times n} \times k : \det(A) \cdot t = 1 \}. 
        \]
        The multiplication map is given by $(A_1, t_1) \cdot (A_2, t_2) = (A_1A_2, t_1t_2)$ is clearly polynomial. The inverse map is given by the polynomial map $(A, t) \mapsto (t \cdot \text{adj}(A), \det A)$ where $\text{adj}(A)$ is the \emph{adjugate matrix}. The coordinate ring is given by 
        \[
            k[\GL_n] = k[Y_{ij}, T] / (\det (Y_{ij}) T - 1) = k[Y_{ij}]_{\det (Y_{ij})}. 
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

\begin{Definition}
    A map $\varphi : G_1 \to G_2$ of linear algebraic groups is a \textbf{morphism of linear algebraic groups} if it is a group homomorphism and also a morphism of varieties. This means that the induced map $\varphi^* : k[G_2] \to k[G_1]$ is a $k$-algebra homomorphism. 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Example}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $G \subseteq \GL_n$ be a closed subgroup. Then the natural embedding $G \hookrightarrow \GL_n$ is a morphism of linear algebraic groups.

        \item The determinant map $\det : \GL_n \to \mathbf{G}_m$ is a group homomorphism and a morphism of varieties. Indeed, the induced map $k[\mathbf{G}_m] \to k[\GL_n]$ is given by 
        \[
            k[T] \simeq k[G_2] \longrightarrow k[Y_{ij}]_{\det (Y_{ij})}, \quad T \mapsto \det(Y_{ij}). 
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

\begin{Proposition}
    Kernels and images of morphisms of algebraic groups are closed. 
\end{Proposition}
\begin{proof}
    The kernel is closed because it is the continuous pre-image of a closed point. From Proposition~\ref{prop:1.6}, the image contains a (non-empty) open subset of its closure. It remains to show that if $G$ is a linear algebraic group, $H \subseteq G$ is a subgroup, and $H$ contains a (non-empty) open subset of its closure, then $H$ is closed. 

    Suppose that $H$ contains a non-empty open subset of $\overline{H}$. Then $H$ is open in $\overline{H}$ since it is the union of translates of this open subset. But it is also closed in $\overline{H}$ since it is the complement of its non-trivial cosets. This implies $H = \overline{H}$ and completes the proof. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Theorem}
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group. Then $G$ can be embedded as a closed subgroup into $\GL_n$ for some $n$. 
\end{Theorem}

The proof of this characterization of linear algebraic groups will be postponed. For an example, we can embed $\mathbf{G}_a \to \GL_2$ via the map 
\[
    t \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 1 & t \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}. 
\]
This is an isomorphism onto a closed subset. 

\subsection{Examples of Algebraic Groups}

In this section we introduce important examples of linear algebraic groups. 

\subsubsection{Upper Triangular Matrices}

The group of invertible upper triangular matrices and the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with $1$'s on the diagonal and the group of diagonal invertible matrices are closed subgroups of $\GL_n$ (hence algebraic groups). 
\begin{align*}
    T_n & \eqdef \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} * & * & * \\ 0 & * & * & \\ 0 & 0 & * \end{pmatrix} \in \GL_n \right \} \\
    U_n & \eqdef \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & * & * \\ 0 & 1 & * & \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in \GL_n \right \} \\
    D_n & \eqdef \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} * & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & * & 0 & \\ 0 & 0 & * \end{pmatrix} \in \GL_n \right \} \\
\end{align*}

\begin{Definition}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item A group $G$ is called \textbf{nilpotent} if the \textbf{descending central series} defined by 
    \[
        \cC^0 G \eqdef G, \quad \cC^i G \eqdef [\cC^{i-1}G, G] \text{ for } i \geq 1
    \]
    eventually reaches $1$. 
    \item A group $G$ is called \textbf{solvable} if the \textbf{derived series} defined by 
    \[
        G^{(0)} \eqdef G, \quad G^{(i)} \eqdef [G^{(i-1)}, G^{(i-1)}] \text{ for } i \geq 1 
    \]
    eventually reaches $1$. The minimum such $d$ for which $G^{(d)} = 1$ is called the \textbf{derived length} of $G$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

For example $U_n$ is nilpotent and $T_n$ is solvable. 
\subsubsection{The special linear groups}

The \textbf{special linear group} of $n \times n$-matrices of determinant $1$ is a closed subgroup of $\GL_n$. 
\[
    \SL_n \eqdef \{A \in \GL_n : \det(A) = 1\}. 
\]
This has coordinate ring $k[\SL_n] = k[T_{ij}] / (\det (T_{ij}) - 1)$. 

\subsubsection{The symplectic groups}

For $n \geq 1$, let $J_{2n} \eqdef \begin{pmatrix} 0 & K_n \\ -K_n & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ where $K_n \eqdef \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. The \textbf{symplectic group} in dimension $2n$ is the closed subgroup 
\[
    \Sp_{2n} \eqdef \{A \in \GL_{2n} : A^t J_{2n} A = J_{2n} \}. 
\]
This is a closed subgroup of $\GL_{2n}$, but the coordinate ring is complicated. The \textbf{conformal symplectic group} is also a closed subgroup of $\GL_{2n}$ and it is defined by 
\[
    \CSp_{2n} \eqdef \{A \in \GL_{2n} : A^t J_{2n} A = c J_{2n} \text{ for some } c \in k^\times \}. 
\]
Indeed, we have a morphism $\GL_n \to \mathbb{A}_k^{n^2}$ defined by $A \mapsto A^t J_{2n} A$. The group $\CSp_{2n}$ is then the pre-image of a closed subvariety isomorphic to $\mathbb{A}_k^1$. 

\subsubsection{Odd-dimensional Orthogonal Groups}

Suppose $\text{char}(k) \neq 2$. The \textbf{orthogonal group} in odd dimension $2n+1$ is defined by 
\[
    \GO_{2n+1} = \{A \in \GL_{2n+1} : A^t K_{2n+1} A = K_{2n+1}\}. 
\]
Alternatively, we can consider the quadratic form 
\[
    f(x_1, \ldots, x_{2n+1}) \eqdef x_1 x_{2n+1} + x_2 x_{2n} + \ldots + x_n x_{n+2} + x_{n+1}^2. 
\]
The group of isometries 
\[
    \GO_{2n+1} \eqdef \{A \in \GL_{2n+1} : f(Ax) = f(x) \text{ for all } x \in k^{2n+1}\}
\]
is the \textbf{odd dimensional orthogonal group} of $k$. We have the conformal version
\[
    \CO_{2n+1} \eqdef \{A \in \GL_{2n+1} : f(Ax) = cf(x) \text{ for all $x \in k^{2n+1}$ and some } c \in k^\times\}. 
\]
This is called the \textbf{odd-dimensional conformal orthogonal group}. The \textbf{even-dimensional} versions are defined similarly. 

\begin{Remark}
    Any non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form, non-degenerate skew-symmetric bilinear forms, and quadratic forms lead to the same groups up to conjugacy. The specific versions we chose above give certain natural subgroups a particularly nice shape. 
\end{Remark}

\subsubsection{Symmetric Group}

Let $G$ be a finite group. Then $G$ has a faithful permutation representation $G \hookrightarrow \fS_n$ into a symmetric group. Moreover, we can embed $\fS_n \hookrightarrow \GL_n$ via the permutation representation. Combining these two, we have a closed embedding $G \hookrightarrow \GL_n$ whose image is a closed subgroup. Therefore, any finite group can be considered as a linear algebraic group, with the discrete topology. 

\subsection{Connectedness}

We say that a space is \textbf{connected} if it cannot be written as the disjoint union of two non-empty proper closed sets. A space is \textbf{irreducible} if it cannot be written as the union of two non-empty proper closed sets. Note that irreducible spaces are connected, but not the other way around. 

\begin{Example}
    We give examples of connected linear algebraic groups. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\mathbf{G}_a$ and $\mathbf{G}_m$ are connected because their coordinate rings are $k[\mathbf{G}_a] = k[x]$ and $k[\mathbf{G}_m] = k[x, x^{-1}]$. These are integral domains, which imply that they are irreducible hence connected. 

        \item $\GL_n$ is connected because the coordinate ring $k[X_{ij}]_{\det(X_{ij})}$ is an integral domain. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

We need the following properties of affine varieties. 

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $X, Y$ be affine varieties. Then we have:
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item A subset $Z$ of $X$ is irreducible if and only if its closure $\overline{Z}$ is irreducible. 
        \item If $X$ and $Y$ are irreducible, then $X \times Y$ is irreducible. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two closed subsets. Then $Z \subseteq C_1 \cup C_2$ if and only if $\overline{Z} \subseteq C_1 \cup C_2$. Part (a) follows immediately. For part (b), it follows from the fact that the tensor product of domains is a domain. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group. 
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item The irreducible components of $G$ are pairwise disjoint, so they are the connected components of $G$. 
        \item The irreducible component $G^\circ$ containing $1 \in G$ is a closed normal subgroup of finite index in $G$. 
        \item Any closed subgroup of $G$ of finite index contains $G^\circ$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    For part (a), let $X$ and $Y$ be irreducible components of $G$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that they intersect. Let $g \in X \cap Y$. Then $g^{-1}X$ and $g^{-1}Y$ are also irreducible components. Thus we can assume that $1 \in X \cap Y$. In this case, $\mu(X \times Y) = XY$ is irreducible since $X \times Y$ is irreducible. But $X \subset XY$ and $Y \subset XY$. Since $X$ and $Y$ are maximal irreducible sets, we have $X = XY = Y$ which completes the proof of (a). 

    For part (b), let $X$ be the irreducible component containing $1$. Then $gXg^{-1}$ is an irreducible component that contains $1$. Thus $X = gXg^{-1}$. We also have $X \subseteq X \cdot X$. Since $X$ is maximal irreducible set, this implies $X = X \cdot X$. Also, we have $X = X^{-1}$. Thus $X$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. The irreducible components are translates of $X$ and they are disjoint. There are only finitely many irreducible components. This implies that $X$ has finite index. Irreducible components are always closed, so it is a closed normal subgroup of finite index in $G$. 

    For part (c), let $H$ be a closed subgroup of $G$ of finite index. Then $H^0 \subseteq G^0 \subseteq G$. We have 
    \[
        [G : H^0] = [G : H] [H : H^0] < \infty
    \] 
    Thus $G^0 = \bigsqcup g H^0$ for finitely many cosets. But, since it is connected, it must be equal to $H^0$. Thus $G^0 = H^0 \subseteq H$. 
\end{proof}

\textcolor{red}{Punchline: } This implies that for linear algebraic groups, the concepts of \emph{connectedness} and \emph{irreducibility} coincide! Thus, we can refer to \emph{connected} and \emph{irreducible} components of $G$ simply as \emph{components}. 

\begin{Example}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group, $H$ a proper closed subgroup of finite index. Then $G$ is not connected because then we can split up $G$ into a finite number of cosets of $H$ ($H$ contains $G^0$). For finite algebraic groups, we always have $G^0 = 1$. 

        \item Recall the definition of the odd-dimensional orthogonal group (in the case $\text{char}(k) \neq 2$):  
        \[
            \GO_{2n+1} = \{A \in \GL_{2n+1} : A^t K_{2n+1} A = K_{2n+1} \}. 
        \]
        The determinant map $\det : \GO_{2n+1} \to \mathbf{G}_m$ has image $\{\pm 1\}$ since $-I_{2n+1} \in \GO_{2n+1}$. This shows that 
        \[
            \GO_{2n+1} \simeq \ker (\det) \times \langle -I_{2n+1} \rangle. 
        \]
        This is not connected. Similarly, $\GO_{2n}$ is not connected because it has a closed subgroup of index $2$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

\begin{Definition}
    For $n \geq 2$, the \textbf{special orthogonal group} $\SO_n \eqdef \GO_n^{\circ}$ is the connected component of the identity in $\GO_n$. 
\end{Definition}

The following fact from algebraic geometry allows one to establish the
connectedness of some algebraic group.

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group and $\varphi_i : Y_i \to G$ be a family of morphisms from irreducible affine varieties $Y_i$ such that $1 \in G_i \eqdef \varphi_i(Y_i)$ for all $i \in I$. Then $H \eqdef \langle G_i : i \in I \rangle$ is a closed and connected subgroup. Moreover, there exist $n \in \NN$ and $(i_1, \ldots, i_n)  \in I^n$ such that $H = G_{i_1}^\pm G_{i_2}^\pm \ldots G_{i_n}^\pm$. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    See Theorem 2.4.6 in~\cite{Geck2013}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Example} \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider the upper and lower triangular groups 
        \[
            U_2^+ = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & * \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \right \} \simeq \mathbf{G}_a, \quad U_2^- = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ * & 1 \end{pmatrix} \right \} \simeq \mathbf{G}_a. 
        \]
        Then one can check $\SL_2 = \langle U_2^+, U_2^- \rangle$. This show that $\SL_2$ is connected. In general, we can show that $\SL_n$, $T_n$, $U_n$, and $D_n$ are all connected. 

        \item Centralizers of elements are not necessarily connected, even in a connected group. Let $G = \SL_2$ and $\text{char}(k) \neq 2$. Let 
        \[
            g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \in G. 
        \]
        The centralizer is 
        \[
            C(g) = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix} : a, b \in k, a^2 = 1 \right \} = H \sqcup \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} H
        \]
        where we have 
        \[
            H = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & b \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} : b \in k \right \}. 
        \]
        $H$ is a closed subgroup of index $2$, which implies that $C(g)$ is not connected. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $H, K$ be subgroups of a linear algebraic group $G$ where $K$ is closed and connected. Then $[H, K]$ is closed and connected. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    $K$ is a linear algebraic group since it is closed. For every $h \in H$, we define the morphism $\varphi_h : K \to G$ by $g \mapsto [h, g]$. Then $[H, K] = \langle \varphi_h(K) \rangle$. From the proposition, we have that $[H, K]$ is closed and connected.   
\end{proof}

In particular, if $G$ is connected, then $[G, G]$ is also connected. 

\subsection{Dimension}

In this section, we discuss the \textbf{dimension} of a linear algebraic group. 

\begin{Definition}
    The following are equivalent definitions for dimension. 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Let $X$ be an irreducible variety. The coordinate ring $k[X]$ is an integral domain. Let $k(X)$ be the field of fractions of $k[X]$. Then $\dim X \eqdef \text{trdeg}_k(k(X))$, the transcendence degree. 

        \item The dimension of $X$ equals the maximal length of decreasing chains of prime ideals in $k[X]$. 

        \item If $X$ is a reducible affine variety, then we can decompose it into $X = X_1 \cup \ldots \cup X_r$. We define $\dim(X)$ to be the maximum of $\dim (X_i)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

In particular, for a linear algebra group, we have $\dim G = \dim G^\circ$. Thus $\dim (G) = 0$ if and only if $G$ is finite. 

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $\varphi : X \to Y$ be a morphism of irreducible varieties with $\varphi(X)$ dense in $Y$. Then there is a non-empty open subset $U \subseteq Y$ with $U \subseteq \varphi(X)$ such that 
    \[
        \dim \varphi^{-1}(y) = \dim (X) - \dim (Y)
    \]
\end{Proposition}

\begin{Corollary}\label{cor:rank-nullity}
    Let $\varphi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a morphism of linear algebraic groups. Then 
    \[
        \dim (\im \varphi) + \dim (\ker \varphi) = \dim (G_1).
    \]
\end{Corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Every fiber is a coset of $\ker (\varphi)$. We can consider the map $\varphi : G_1^\circ \to \im (\varphi)^\circ$. We get 
    \[
        \dim \ker (\varphi) = \dim G_1 - \dim (\im (\varphi))
    \]
    which suffices for the proof. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Example}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\dim (\mathbf{G}_a) = 1$ since $k[\mathbf{G}_a] = k[x]$ and every prime ideal has height $1$. 
        \item $\dim (\mathbf{G}_m) = 1$ since $k[\mathbf{G}_m] = k[x, x^{-1}]$, it has the same field of fractions of $\mathbf{G}_a$. 
        \item $\dim \GL_n = n^2$ since the field of fractions is just $k(Y_{ij})$. 
        \item $\dim \SL_n = n^2 - 1$ from Corollary~\ref{cor:rank-nullity}. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

\begin{Proposition}
    If $Y$ is a proper closed subset of an irreducible variety $X$, then $\dim Y < \dim X$. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    The induced map is a quotient map by a prime ideal. This means we can always extend a chain of prime ideals in $k[Y]$ to a chain of prime ideals in $k[X]$. This suffices for the proof. 
\end{proof}

\section{Jordan Decomposition}

\subsection{Decomposition of endomorphisms}

Recall the statement of the usual Jordan decomposition.

\begin{Theorem}[Jordan-Chevalley Decomposition]
    Let $V$ be a vector space over a nice enough field $k$. Let $a \in \End(V)$ be an endomorphism. Then there are unique $n, s \in \End(V)$ with $n$ nilpotent and $s$ semisimple where $a = n + s$ and $ns = sn$. In this case, there are polynomials $P, Q \in T \cdot k[T]$ such that $s = P(a)$ and $n = Q(a)$. 
\end{Theorem}

This can easily be translated to a multiplicative Jordan decomposition of $\GL(V)$. 

\begin{Definition}
    An endomorphism $u \in End(V)$ is called \textbf{unipotent} if $u - 1$ is nilpotent. 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Proposition}
    For $g \in \GL(V)$, there exist unique $s, u \in \GL(V)$ with $s$ simple and $u$ unipotent such that $g = su = us$. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $g = s + n$ be an additive Jordan decomposition. Let $u = 1 + s^{-1}n$. Then, we have 
    \[
        su = s(1 + s^{-1}n) = s + n = (1 + s^{-1}n)s =us. 
    \]
    This gives a multiplicative Jordan decomposition of $g$. To prove the uniqueness of the multiplicative Jordan decomposition, suppose that we have two $g = s_1 u_1$ and $g = s_2 u_2$. Then, we have 
    \[
        g = s_1 + s_1(u_1 - 1) = s_2 + s_2(u_2 - 1)
    \]
    are two additive Jordan decompositions. From the uniqueness of the additive version, we have $s_1 = s_2$ and $u_1 = u_2$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{Definition}
    In the above, we call $s$ the \textbf{semisimple part}, $n$ the \textbf{nilpotent part}, and $u$ the \textbf{unipotent part}. 
\end{Definition}

For each $x \in G$, consider the right multiplication map $r_x : G \to G$ given by $r_x(g) = gx$. This is a morphism of affine algebraic varieties. This corresponds to a $k$-algebra morphism $\rho_x : k[G] \to k[G]$ given by 
\[ 
    \rho_x(f)(g) \eqdef f(gx), \quad \text{ for all $f \in k[G]$ and $g \in G$}.
\]
This gives $k[G]$ an (abstract) left $G$-action. We have the following "local" result: 

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group and $V$ a finite-dimensional subspace of $k[G]$. Then there exists a finite-dimensional $G$-invariant subspace $X$ of $k[G]$ containing $V$. In particular, $k[G]$ is the union of finite dimensional $G$-invariant subspaces. Moreover, the restriction to any such finite-dimensional subspace $X$ affords a morphism of algebraic groups $\rho : G \to \GL(X)$. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to prove this result for $V = \CC \langle f \rangle$ a one-dimensional subspace of $k[G]$. The multiplication map gives a $k$-algebra morphism 
    \[
        \mu^* : k[G] \to k[G \times G] = k[G] \otimes k[G]. 
    \]
    Let $\mu^*(f) = \sum f_i \otimes g_i$ where the sum is finite. Then $\rho_x(f) = \sum_i g_i(x) f_i$ from Equation~\ref{eqn:com-diagram-Pog}.

    \begin{equation}\label{eqn:com-diagram-Pog}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            G && {G \times G} && G \\
            \\
            \\
            {k[G]} && {k[G] \otimes k[G]} && {k[G]}
            \arrow["{g \mapsto (g, x)}", from=1-1, to=1-3]
            \arrow["{r_x}"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-5]
            \arrow["\mu", from=1-3, to=1-5]
            \arrow["{f \otimes g \mapsto g(x)f}"', from=4-3, to=4-1]
            \arrow["{\rho_x}", curve={height=-30pt}, from=4-5, to=4-1]
            \arrow["{\mu^*}"', from=4-5, to=4-3]
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{equation}

    This implies that $\{\rho_x (f)\}$ is contained in the finite dimension vector space spanned by $\{f_i\}$. Thus $G \cdot V$ is $G$-invariant and is finite-dimensional. The coordinates of $\rho_x$ are clearly polynomial. Thus $g \mapsto \rho_x |_X$ gives a morphism of linear algebraic groups $G \mapsto \GL(X)$. 
\end{proof}

Let $V$ be a $k$-vector space. We say $x \in \End(V)$ is \textbf{locally finite} if $V$ is the union of finite-dimensional $x$-stable subspaces. We say $x$ is \textbf{locally semisimple}, respectively \textbf{locally nilpotent}, if its restriction to any finite-dimensional $x$-stable subspace is semisimple, respectively nilpotent. 

Any locally finite endomorphism of $V$ has a Jordan decomposition. We also know that $\rho_x$ is a locally finite endomorphism of $k[G]$ for all $x \in G$. This allows us to prove the following theorem. 

\begin{Theorem}[Jordan decomposition]
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group. 
    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item For any embedding $\rho$ of $G$ into some $\GL(V)$ and for any $g \in G$, there exist unique $g_s, g_u \in G$ such that $g = g_s g_u = g_u g_s$ where $\rho(g_s)$ is semisimple and $\rho(g_u)$ is unipotent. 
        \item The decomposition $g = g_s g_u = g_u g_s$ is independent of the chosen embedding. 
        \item Let $\varphi : G_1 \to G_2$ be a morphism of algebraic groups. Then $\varphi(g_s) = \varphi(g)_s$ and $\varphi(g_u) = \varphi(g)_u$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem}


\begin{proof}
    For part (a), the endomorphism $\rho_g : k[G] \to k[G]$ is locally finite, invertible linear transformation. There is a Jordan decomposition $\rho_g = (\rho_g)_s (\rho_g)_u$. Since $\rho_g$ is an algebra morphism, we can deduce that $(\rho_g)_s$ and $(\rho_g)_u$ are also algebra morphisms. Then, we maps 
    \[
        f \mapsto (\rho_g)_s(f)(e), \quad f \mapsto (\rho_g)_u(f)(e)
    \]  
    are algebra homomorphism $k[G] \to k$. That is, they correspond to points $g_s, g_u \in k[G]$. In other words, for all $f \in k[G]$ we have $(\rho_g)_s(f)(e) = g_s$ and $(\rho_g)_u (f)(e) = g_u$. We have that 
    \[
        ((\rho_g)_s f) (x) = (\ell(x^{-1}) (\rho_g)_s f)(e) = ((\rho_g)_s \ell(x^{-1}) f)(e) = \ell(x^{-1}) f (g_s) = \rho_{g_s} f(x).
    \]
    Thus, we have ${(\rho_g)}_s = \rho_{g_s}$ and similarly ${(\rho_g)}_u = \rho_{g_u}$. We have $\rho_g = \rho_{g_1} \rho_{g_2} = \rho_{g_1g_2}$ and $\rho_g = \rho_{g_2} \rho_{g_1} = \rho_{g_2g_1}$. Thus $g = g_u g_s = g_sg_u$. 
\end{proof}


\begin{Definition}
    Let $G$ be a linear algebraic group. The decomposition $g = g_u g_s = g_s g_u$ is called the \textbf{Jordan decomposition} of $g \in G$, and $g$ is called semisimple, respectively unipotent, if $g = g_s$, respectively $g = g_u$. We write $G_u$ for the unipotent elements and $G_s$ for the semisimple elements. 
\end{Definition}

\begin{Example}
    \phantom{h}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The additive group $\mathbf{G}_a$ is a unipotent group (and more generally so is $U_n$). This is because we can embed it into 
        \[
            \mathbf{G}_a = \left \{ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & a \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} : a \in k \right \}.
        \]

        \item $\mathbf{G}_m$ and $D_n$ consist of only semisimple elements. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{Example}

In general $G_u$ is closed, but $G_s$ is badly behaved. For example, lets look at $G = \GL_2$ and $g \in G \backslash G_s$. Then $g$ is conjugate to $\begin{pmatrix} a & 1 \\ 0 & a \end{pmatrix}$ for some $a \in k^\times$. We can define $\varphi : \mathbf{G}_m \to \GL_2$ by $\varphi(t) = \begin{pmatrix} at & 1 \\ 0 & at^{-1} \end{pmatrix}$. Then $\varphi$ is a morphism and $\varphi(t)$ is semisimple whenever $t \neq \pm 1$. This means $\varphi(\mathbf{G}_m \backslash \{\pm 1\}) \subseteq G_s$. We have 
\[
    \varphi(\mathbf{G}_m) = \varphi \left ( \overline{\mathbf{G}_m \backslash \{ \pm 1 \}} \right ) \subseteq \overline{G_s}
\]
Thus all non-semisimple elements lie in $\overline{G_s}$ so $\overline{G_s} = G$.

\subsection{Unipotent groups}

\begin{Proposition}
    Let $G \leq \GL_n$ be a unipotent group. Then there exists $g \in \GL_n$ such that $g^{-1} G g \leq U_n$. 
\end{Proposition}

\begin{proof}
    Let $V = k^n$. We induct on $n$. For $n = 1$, the only unipotent element in $\GL_1$ is $1$. This case is clear. Now suppose that $n > 1$. Suppose that there is a $G$-invariant proper subspace $0 \neq W \subseteq V$. By picking an appropriate basis, we have 
    \[
        G \leq \left \{\begin{pmatrix} * & * \\ 0 & * \end{pmatrix} \right \}.
    \]  
    The $G$-invariance induces natural homomorphisms $\varphi : G \to \GL(W)$, $\Phi : G \to \GL(V/W)$. By induction, up to a change of basis, we have 
    \[
        G \leq \left \{ 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & * & * & * \\
            0 & 1 & * & * \\
            0 & 0 & 1 & * \\
            0 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix} \right \} = U_n
    \]
    as claimed. 
    
    If $V$ is a irreducible representation of $G$, then the elements of $g$ generate the full endomorphism algebra $\End(V)$. Note that $\tr((g-1)h) = \tr(gh) - \tr(h) = 0$ for all $g, h \in G$ since the trace of unipotent elements is $n$. This implies that $\tr((g-1)x) = 0$ for all $x \in \End(V)$. This can only happen if $g = 1$. But this implies $G = 1$, contradicting irreducibility of $G$ acting on $V$. 
\end{proof}
